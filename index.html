        <h1 id="myTitle">Wagner: The Ring of the Nibelung</h1>
        <p>Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), is a cycle of four
             German-language epic music dramas composed by Richard Wagner. 
             The works are based loosely on characters from the Norse sagas and the Nibelungenlied. 
             The composer termed the cycle a "Bühnenfestspiel" (stage festival play), structured in 
             three days preceded by a Vorabend ("preliminary evening"). 
             It is often referred to as the Ring Cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply The Ring.</p>

        <p> Wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. 
                The four parts that constitute the Ring cycle are, in sequence:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Das Rheingold</li>
                <li>Die Walküre</li>
                <li>Siegfried</li>
                <li>Götterdämmerung</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The cycle is a work of extraordinary scale. Perhaps the most outstanding facet of the
                 monumental work is its sheer length: a full performance of the cycle takes place over 
                 four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the
                 conductor's pacing. The first and shortest work, Das Rheingold, typically lasts two and
                  a half hours, while the final and longest, Götterdämmerung, takes up to five hours, 
                  excluding intervals. The cycle is modelled after ancient Greek dramas that were presented
                   as three tragedies and one satyr play. The Ring proper begins with Die Walküre and ends
                    with Götterdämmerung, with Rheingold as a prelude. Wagner called Das Rheingold a 
                    Vorabend or "Preliminary Evening", and Die Walküre, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung 
                    were subtitled First Day, Second Day and Third Day, respectively, 
                    of the trilogy proper.</p>
                    
            <h3>Das Rheingold</h3>
            <p>In the depths of the Rhine, the three Rhinemaidens guard the Rhinegold, a treasure of immeasurable value. 
                The Nibelung dwarf Alberich is dazzled first by the maidens and then by their treasure. Wellgunde reveals that whoever can forge the
                  gold into a ring will gain mastery over the world. The required magic can be attained only by 
                  renouncing love. Alberich curses love vehemently and steals the gold.<a href="rheingold.html"> Read more</a></p>
            <h3>Die Walküre</h3>
            <p>As a storm rages, Siegmund the Wälsung, exhausted from pursuit by enemies in the forest, stumbles into a house for shelter.
                 Sieglinde finds the stranger lying by the hearth, and the two feel an immediate attraction. But they are soon interrupted by 
                 Sieglinde’s husband, Hunding, who asks the stranger who he is. Calling himself ‘Woe-full’, Siegmund tells of a life filled with
                  sorrow, only to learn that Hunding is a kinsman of his foes. Hunding challenges the stranger to combat the next day. Left alone,
                   Siegmund calls on his father, Wälse, for the sword he once promised him. <a href="walkure.html"> Read more</a></p> 
            <h3>Siegfried</h3>
            <p>In his forest cave Mime, hammering at an anvil, complains of his hard existence, forging swords for Siegfried to smash. If only he 
                could reforge Nothung then Siegfried could kill the dragon Fafner and win for Mime the ring and Nibelung treasure, but he knows he 
                is unequal to the task of mending the sword. Siegfried enters presenting a bear, sending the terrified Mime behind the anvil. When 
                Siegfried is given his latest sword, he immediately breaks it and berates its maker who attempts to calm the boy by reminding him how 
                he brought up the lonely orphan.<a href="siegfried.html"> Read more</a></p>
            <h3>Götterdämmerung</h3>
            <p>On the Valkyries’ rock, three Norns spin the rope of Fate, recalling Wotan’s days of power and predicting Valhalla’s imminent fall. 
                When the rope breaks they descend in terror to their mother, Erda, goddess of the earth. At dawn Siegfried and his bride, Brünnhilde, 
                emerge from their cave. Though fearful that she may lose the hero, she sends him forth to deeds of valour. To remind her of his love, 
                Siegfried gives Brünnhilde the magic ring of the Nibelung. Rapturously they bid farewell as Siegfried sets out down
                 the Rhine.<a href="gotterdammerung.html"> Read more</a></p>
